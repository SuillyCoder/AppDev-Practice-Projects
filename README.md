# AppDev-Practice-Projects
These are a series of applications (in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) made as a form of AppDev Project Development Practice. 
All of these were made in the span of two months. Care to know what they are?

Well here's an explanation of each and every one of them: 

<h3>APPLICATION 1: MINI QUIZ APP</h3>
This was the first application designed to test users in a series of questions
ranging from easy, medium, to hard difficulty. It even has the option for the
user to take it again to improve their knowlegde.

<h3>APPLICATION 2: CALCULATOR</h3>
This was the second application designed to take in user input and calculate
whatever the user wants. A side note though is that this is only a very basic 
calculator and doesnt involve a lot of other functions.

<h3>APPLICATION 3: TO DO LIST TRACKER</h3>
This was the third application designed to let the user input tasks they need to
do and save them within an archive in order to keep track. This app also keeps
your history of task records even as you refresh the browser.

<h3>APPLICATION 4: PASSWORD GENERATOR</h3>
This was the fourth application designed to let the user generate a random password
from a set of random characters. Users are able to increase and decrease the password
length in order to alter their passwords as they wish.

<h3>APPLICATION 5: STOPWATCH TIMER</h3>
This was the fifth application designed to let the user record time just as a regular
stopwatch would. Although this application doesnt account for miliseconds (since it's buggy),
it makes up for it by having a feature to record laps within the time period.

<h3>APPLICATION 6: TEXT TO SPEECH CONVERTER</h3>
This was the sixth application designed to let the user input some desired text and 
synthesize it to actual speech. You are also able to adjust the volume, but by a fair
amount. This application also serves as the first use of APIs.

<h3>APPLICATION 7: SEARCH ENGINE APP</h3>
This was rhe seventh and last application designed to let the user input their
search prompt and receive images of what they're looking for. It also allows them
to see their browser history on the side for them to keep track. 

<h2>NOTE: </h2>All of these application serve as a way for me to learn
how to go around webdev and how application development works. Of course, 
I am still far from where I need to be, but at least I'm getting somewhere.

:D :D :D
